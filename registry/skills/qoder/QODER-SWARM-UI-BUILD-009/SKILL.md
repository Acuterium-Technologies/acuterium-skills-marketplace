description: "Multi-agent swarm workflow for building complete Acuterium ACAI V2 interfaces — orchestrates token setup, component scaffolding, cognitive engine wiring, motion integration, edition theming, and cross-platform deployment. Follows BDIS swarm pattern. Use when building a full Acuterium app from scratch or coordinating multi-agent UI construction. Thread 13 — ACAI V2."

# Swarm-Orchestrated UI Construction Workflow

## 5 Specialized Agent Roles
1. **Architect Agent:** Requirements, edition selection, platform(s), project scaffold
2. **Token Agent:** Design tokens, theme switching, CSS vars / Swift env / Compose locals
3. **Component Agent:** Glass component library per QODER-GLASS-COMP-003
4. **Cognitive Agent:** Wire NEXUS, PATHOS, KAIROS, MNEMOS, TELOS, Face2Feel per QODER-COGNITIVE-ENGINES-004
5. **Motion Agent:** Morphing, particles, breathing orb, consciousness bar per QODER-MOTION-MORPH-005

## 7-Mission Build Sequence
M1: Requirements + edition detection → M2: Scaffold + tokens → M3: Glass components → M4: Cognitive engines → M5: Motion + CHRONOS → M6: Cross-platform build → M7: Validation + a11y audit

**Dependency:** M1→M2→(M3||M4)→M5→M6→M7

## Handoff Protocol
```yaml
handoff:
  from: {agent_role}
  to: {agent_role}
  artifacts: [files created]
  status: complete | partial | blocked
  next_actions: [what receiving agent should do]
```

## Quality Gates
After M2: Token validation (all editions render). After M3: Visual regression. After M4: Init sequence test. After M5: Particle budget <2ms. After M6: Cross-platform parity. After M7: WCAG AA audit.
